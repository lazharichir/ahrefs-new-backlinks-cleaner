This script must be hosted on Google Cloud Functions and allows you to upload a CSV file from Ahrefs' New Backlinks report for a site and cleans up all the nonsensical backlinks (spam, fake sites, etc) based on a few rules and heuristics.

It was built to be used internally as a quick way to perform "link building mimicking" by spying on the latest backlinks our competitors got. This tool allowed us to only view and consider real referring domains and remove all the spammers and low-quality websites.

No longer using this strategy so making this little script public. No longer maintained but the code is pretty straightforward.
